# Beer-Consumption

This dataset is a catalog of beer consumption in Sao Paolo over one year. [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dongeorge/beer-consumption-sao-paulo), here you can see that it has exactly 365 points for each day


# Predication

This a linear regression task and we try to predict the Beer Consumption in liters for a everyday based on Median Temperature, Maximum Temperature and Day Type(weekday or weekend).  

# Model

I used a Linear Regression model from the sklearn packages for this dataset. It is a multivariate analysis which gives a max accuracy of 72%

**Linear Regression** is a machine learning algorithm based on **supervised learning**. It performs a **regression task**. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on â€“ the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.

The equation for predicting is generally of form:
<br>
y = a0 + a1*x (for single variable)
<br>
y = a0 + a1*x1 + a2*x2 + a3*x3 + ... + an*xn (for single variable)

## Future Work
At the moment this dataset is kind of stagnant for future work and newer implementations we would need some more data at the very least.
